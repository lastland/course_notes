\section{More Finite Automata}

Recall: every DFA recognizes some (regular) language, a language is regular if there exists some DFA recognizing it.  NFAs also recognize regular languages (every DFA is also an NFA).

Question: are NFAs more powerful than DFAs?  They are certainly a broader class of machines, given that the set of all DFAs is a propers subset of the set of all NFAs.

\theorem{NFAs recognize exactly the class of regular languages.}

\begin{proof}
	\textit{(A rough sketch)}
	
	Consider an NFA $M$ without $\epsilon$-transitions.  We can imagine a string's traversal as maintaining a set of possible states you are in, and the NFA accepts if and only that set contains a final state at the conclusion of reading the string.  Let's consider the set of states at each step.
	
	Create a DFA $M'$ with states corresponding to subsets of states of the NFA.  Now, add transitions in $M'$ corresponding to the set of possible transitions in $M$.  Formally, let $S\subseteq Q$, then $\delta ' (S,a) = \bigcup\limits_{q\in S} \delta (q,a)$.  These subsets $S$ correspond to states in $M'$.
	
	The start state of $M'$, $q_0 '$ is the state corresponding to $\{q_0\}$.  The final states of $M'$, $F'$ are the subsets of $Q$ containing at least one element of $F$.
	
	We can deal with $\epsilon$-transitions by extending $\delta '$ to also include all states reachable from reading $a$ and a following $\epsilon$.  Formally, define $E(q)$ as the set of states reachable from $q$ without consuming an input character (i.e. $0$ or more $\epsilon$-transitions).  Then make $\delta '(S,a) = \bigcup\limits_{p\in E(q)\  : \ q\in S}\delta(p,a)$.
	
	
\end{proof}
