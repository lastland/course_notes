\section*{About}
\textsl{{\Large I took these notes during the Spring 2017 iteration of Professor Sampath Kannan's Theory of Computation (CIS511) course.  The course followed \textit{Introduction to the Theory of Computation (3ed)} by Michael Sipser. As taking notes in \LaTeX\xspace on-the-fly is not an easy task, I am sure this document is full of typos, sloppy notation, and small mathematical errors.  If you find such an error, please send me an email at \{\texttt{ianzach+notes[at]seas.upenn.edu}\} so I can correct it.\\}}
